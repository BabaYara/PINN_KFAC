# Taylor Mode PINNs

This repository provides a minimal Python package implementing basic routines for
Taylor-mode automatic differentiation and a stub KFAC optimizer for
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

The code is intentionally simple to act as a starting point for further
development following the blueprint in `Plan.tex`.
